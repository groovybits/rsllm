# Rust LLM Stream Analyzer and Content Generator

The Rust LLM Stream Analyzer and Content Generator is optimized for MacOS Metal GPUs leveraging the Candle framework from Huggingface, represents a cutting-edge approach to AI model interaction and stream analysis on MacOS devices equipped with M1/M2/M3 ARM GPUs. This toolkit is meticulously designed for developers and researchers aiming to integrate local large language models (LLMs) with high efficiency, bypassing the need for external dependencies and Python servers. At its core, it emphasizes the utilization of local LLMs for generating text, images, and speech within a Rust environment, offering a robust suite of features for real-time data stream analysis and AI-driven content creation.

## Highlighted Features

-   **Local LLM Focus**: Utilizes Candle's Rust-based LLMs, Mistral and Gemma, for direct and efficient AI interactions, prioritizing local execution to harness the full power of MacOS Metal GPUs.
-   **Comprehensive AI Analyzer**: Embeds a sophisticated AI analyzer capable of processing inputs and generating outputs across text, voice, speech, and images, facilitating a seamless flow of AI-generated content. (Work in Progress)
-   **Voice and Speech Integration**: Plans to incorporate Whisper for voice-driven interactions, akin to Alexa, allowing users to communicate with the toolkit using voice commands and receive streaming text inputs in response. (Planned Feature)
-   **Image Generation and NDI Output**: Supports generating images from text descriptions and outputting through NDI for a wide range of applications, including real-time content creation and broadcasting. (In Beta Testing)
-   **TTS MetaVoice / Mimic3 TTS API / OpenAI TTS API**: Candle implements TTS using MetaVoice which is the default but a WIP as the author is shoring up the implementation quality and optimizing for Metal GPUs (isn't realtime currently, sounds very "wavy"). OpenAI TTS API support generates very nice speech for a prie if wanting quality/realtime speech generation. Mimic3 TTS API requires running the mimic3-server and is a bit more involved but is a good alternative to OpenAI TTS API since it is free if you have a local system. <https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic3>

## Core Components

### Candle Framework Integration

Candle, a project by Huggingface, offers Rust-native LLMs like Mistral and Gemma, optimized for Metal GPUs on MacOS. This integration facilitates local execution of LLMs, ensuring high performance and low latency in AI model interactions.

### OpenAI API Support

While the toolkitâ€™s primary focus is on running local LLMs, it also provides support for the OpenAI API, enabling users to leverage external AI models when necessary. This feature ensures versatility and broad applicability in various AI-driven projects.

### Real-time AI Analysis and Content Generation

The toolkit excels in analyzing real-time data streams and generating AI-driven content, including text, images, and speech. It aims to create a dynamic interaction model where voice inputs can be converted into text commands for the LLM, and the generated outputs can be streamed back as voice or visual content.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

-   Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed. [Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
-   MacOS system with M1/M2/M3 ARM GPU.

### Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/groovybits/rsllm.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd rsllm
    ```

3. **Compile with Metal GPU Support and NDI SDK support**:
    ```bash
    # export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    # cargo build --release --features=metal,ndi
    ## run the compile.sh which basically does the above command + gets the libndi.dylib.
    ./scripts/compile.sh # Script helps handle the NDI SDK dependency and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

### Configuration

-   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize the settings, including the OpenAI API key if intending to use external AI models.

## Usage

The toolkit is designed to facilitate a wide range of AI-driven operations, from generating text-based content to analyzing network streams and processing visual and audio inputs. Advanced features like NDI audio output and voice-to-text input processing are in development, aiming to enhance the interactive capabilities of the toolkit.

### Example Commands

-   Use the scripts in the [./scripts](./scripts/) directory.

    ```bash
    [./scripts/compile.sh](./scripts/compile.sh) # build rsllm

    ./scripts/mpeg_analyzer.sh
    ./scripts/mpeg_poetry.sh
    ./scripts/system_health.sh
    ```

-   **Running with Candle and OS Stats for AI System Analysis**:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release --features ndi,metal -- \
      --candle_llm gemma \
      --model-id "2b-it" \
      --max-tokens 1000 \
      --temperature 0.8 \
      --ai-os-stats \
      --sd-image \
      --ndi-images \
      --ndi-audio \
      --system-prompt "you create image prompts from os system stats health state." \
      --query "How is my system doing? Create a report on the system health as visual image descriptions."
    ```

## Enhanced Output Capabilities and Upcoming Features

### NDI Output for Images and TTS Speech Audio

The toolkit is enhancing its output capabilities to include NDI (Network Device Interface) support for images and TTS (Text-to-Speech) audio, facilitating high-quality, low-latency video streaming over IP networks.

-   **(OPTIONAL) NDI SDK Installation**: The [compile.sh](scripts/compile.sh] script will download hte libndi.dylib for you. If you want to, you can Download and install the NDI SDK from [here](https://ndi.video/download-ndi-sdk/). This SDK is useful for viewing the NDI output and other tools to explore.
-   **Configuration Steps**:
    1. Add `--features ndi` to the Cargo build command to include NDI support in your build.
    2. Run scripts/compile.sh which will retreive the libndi.dylib which works best for MacOS.
    ````
    3. To ensure the library is correctly recognized when building with `cargo --features=ndi`, set the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:
    ```bash
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ````
-   **Additional Configuration**: Logging into the Huggingface Hub via the CLI can resolve some potential warnings. Execute `huggingface-cli login` to authenticate.

### MetaVoice TTS Text to Speech (WIP)

Candle, our core Rust framework for LLM interaction has MetaVoice now, a groundbreaking Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. As this feature improves it will enable pure Rust-based LLM, TTI (Text-to-Image), and TTS functionalities, seamlessly integrated with Metal GPU optimizations for MacOS.

-   **Development Status**: The MetaVoice integration is done and being optimized in Candle so that quality matches the reference implementation.
-   **Anticipated Benefits**: Once full quality/optimized, MetaVoice will significantly enhance the toolkit's ability to generate lifelike speech from text without costing and low latency on a local LLM. Also it will give the ability to one shot learn a voice from a small clip and generate speech from it. For now you may want to use OpenAI for quality/realtime generation of the speech audio.

RsLLM has a mission to research and explore implementing a versatile, high-performance toolkit for AI-driven content creation and analysis on MacOS, leveraging the full potential of Metal GPUs and Rust's efficiency.
